    <li id="story">A friendâ€™s Tale - friendship
        <p>
            When in a new place it brings about excitement as well as anxiety but my stress was reduced by many folds when I met my then-neighbor Pooja*(name changed on request) who was a newlywed with a glow that only a new bride can possess.<br> We immediately became fast friends. Army life has a beautiful way of bringing together people due to the mere absence of husbands on many occasions including festivals. Although Deolali Camp was new to us but with Pooja there it seemed we had been there for years.

    <li>A new beginning - love
        <p>We got married in the scorching heat of May and being wedded to an olive green was a whole new experience. I was anxious about the new beginning but he was gentle, and kind and held me every step of the way. <br> Our initial days of marriage were spent away from each other as he was in his unit which was in the field and me with my In-laws. I was shy and quiet and this new life was difficult to manage without him by my side but the army way of life teaches you everything from patience to perseverance. </p>
